# visible water has positive correlation with Pied kingfisher ***--> higher values for visible water quality, so higher value sof TDS, conductivity and turbidity --> less clear water would suggest higher number of pied kingfishers
# no correlation between chemical and visible water quality
# chemical water quality has positive correlation with small schooling fish *** --> higher values for pH, temp, HDO etc give higher number of fish schools

# However the multiple regression tests how much variation is explained by a predictor that is not explained by the other predictors in the model. So when two predictors are strongly correlated, each may not explain variation in the response independently, why the regression of each with the response may be highly significant.
# path analysis (form of SEM) can analyse causal relations between the different predictors, instead of hypothesizing that they all directly affect the response variable

# make SEM model and fit with lavaan
