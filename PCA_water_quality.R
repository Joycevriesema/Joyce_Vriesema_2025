# point 376 has a very high turbidity, very low conductivity and low TDS, depth 0.46
# point 376 was recorded at 11:07:58, which coincides with the exact start time of the transect, seconds moved = 2 and meters moved = 2  suggesting the multiprobe may not yet have been fully submerged. The shallow depth (0.46m) supports this assumption. Partial submersion may also explain the unusually high HDO saturation and turbidity, as the sensors may have measured surface water or even been partially exposed to air.
# there is some time issue with the Manta multimeter probe therefore it could be that the measurement already started but, while the transect was not yet started

# point 621: TDS relatively low, conductivity low, turbidity high, depth 0.47, suggest that the probe is held more close to the surface
# point 739 also has low conductivity and TDS.
# most values of conductivity in the df are above 100 and TDS above 70, these three data points deviate strongly
