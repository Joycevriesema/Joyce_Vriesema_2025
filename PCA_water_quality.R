# points 376 and 697 suggest outliers
# point 376 has a very high turbidity, very low conductivity and low TDS, depth 0.46
# point 376 was recorded at 11:07:58, which coincides with the exact start time of the transect, seconds moved = 2 and meters moved = 2  suggesting the multiprobe may not yet have been fully submerged. The shallow depth (0.46m) supports this assumption. Partial submersion may also explain the unusually high HDO saturation and turbidity, as the sensors may have measured surface water or even been partially exposed to air.

# point 697: TDS relatively low, conductivity low, turbidity high, depth 0.47, suggest that the probe is held more close to the surface, point 696 is 0.81 meter and point 697 is 0.47 and 698 also 0.47 so maybe the probe was drawn a bit to the surface
